== Introduction
The `CloudCacheStore` implementation utilizes link:$$https://jclouds.apache.org/$$[JClouds]
to communicate with cloud storage providers such as link:$$http://aws.amazon.com/s3/$$[Amazon's S3],
Rackspace's link:$$http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/files$$[Cloudfiles]
or any other such provider supported by JClouds.

=== Amazon
If you're planning to use Amazon S3 for storage, consider using it with Infinispan.
Infinispan itself provides in-memory caching for your data to minimize the amount
of remote access calls, thus reducing the latency and cost of fetching your
Amazon S3 data.

With cache replication, you are also able to load data from your local cluster
without having to remotely access it every time.

==== Transactions
Note that Amazon S3 does not support transactions.

If transactions are used in your application then there is some possibility of
state inconsistency when using this cache loader.

However, writes are atomic, in that if a write fails nothing is considered
written and data is never corrupted.

== Javadoc
For a list of configuration refer to the link:$$http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/stores/cloud/9.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/cloud/configuration/CloudStoreConfigurationBuilder.html$$[javadoc] . 

== Configuration

NOTE: for details on configuration specific to each underlying provider, refer to the JClouds BlobStore docs at https://jclouds.apache.org/reference/providers/#blobstore

The following example shows how to connect to an S3 store:
